## Hands-on Superconducting Qubit Characterization

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [Hands-on Superconducting Qubit Characterization](https://www.zhinst.com/blogs/hands-superconducting-qubit-characterization).

The Jupyter notebook [Single-Qubit-Tuneup.md](Single-Qubit-Tuneup.md) describes how to implement resonator spectrsocopy, qubit spectroscopy, Rabi, and single-shot readout experiments using the domain specific language of LabOne Q.

The file [tuneup_helper.py](tuneup_helper.py) contains fitting routines for extracting the qubit parameters from the measurement data.
